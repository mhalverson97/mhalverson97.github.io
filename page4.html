	<h1><font color=" navy">Hiking</h1>

	<P>This year, 2017, was actually the first time I have ever gone hiking.
	It has always been an interest of mine since I am from a small
	farm town in Illinois. By me, all you see is corn and cows
	licking windows in the library. Hiking allowed me to see the world
	from a different level (no pun intended). It is definitely
	tough to get up the mountains but it is well worth it -- 
	just look at the views. They are breathtaking.</P>

<p><i>Although I have only climbed a few mountains, I plan on
continuing throughout my years here in college and as long as
I possibly can. </i></p>
