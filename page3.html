<p><i>Above, you'll see a photo of me and my parents at Senior night
for track. They're my biggest fans!</i></p>
<p><i>You will also see one of my me and my team who made it to
State one year. As a freshman, I cam in as the fastest runner in the
entire sectional, county, and conference -- let alone school. 
I made it to State 3 years in a row excluding my last year
because I got injured from being overworked.
I even went to the Nationals  Junior Olympics
in Humble Texas.</i></p>
